Pomelo fills this gap, providing a full solution for building game server frameworks.\nPomelo has the following advantages:\n* The architecture is scalable. It uses multi-process, single thread runtime architecture, which has been proven in industry and is  especially suited to the node.js thread model.\n* Easy to use, the development model is quite similiar to web, using convention over configuration, almost zero config. The [API](http://pomelo.netease.com/api.html) is also easy to use.\n* The framework is extensible. Based on node.js micro module principle, the core of pomelo is small. All the components, libraries and tools are individual npm modules, anyone can create their own module to extend the framework.\n* The reference materials and documentation are quite complete. Besides documents, we also provide [an open-source MMO RPG demo](https://github.com/NetEase/pomelo/wiki/Introduction-to--Lord-of-Pomelo) (HTML5 client), which is a far better reference material than any book.\n\n## How can I develop with pomelo?\nWith the following references, you can quickly familiarize yourself with the pomelo development process:\n* [Architecture Overview of pomelo](https://github.com/NetEase/pomelo/wiki/Architecture-overview-of-pomelo)\n* [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/NetEase/pomelo/wiki/Quick-start-guide)\n* [Tutorial](https://github.com/NetEase/pomelo/wiki/Tutorial)\n* [FAQ](https://github.com/NetEase/pomelo/wiki/FAQ)\n\nYou can also learn from our MMO demo:\n* [Introduction to Lord of Pomelo](https://github.com/NetEase/pomelo/wiki/Introduction-to--Lord-of-Pomelo)\n\n## Contributors\n* NetEase, Inc.\n* Aaron Yoshitake\n* Eduard Gotwig\n* Eric Muyser\n\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012-2013 NetEase, Inc. and other contributors\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n",
